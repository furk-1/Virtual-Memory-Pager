# Virtual-Memory-Pager
External pager for handling virtual memory requests

Project was done in collaboration with another student at UMass.

Pager.cc is the pager application itself, test*.cc are mutation testing files that evaluates how the pager performs in different virtual memory situations.

Short bulleted description:
  Implemented an external memory pager that handled virtual memory requests for other application processes
  Pager was created to execute address space creation and destruction, page faults, and simple argument passing between virtual and physical address spaces
  Developed familiarity with low-level system calls, kernel operations, multi-threaded programming, and mutation testing
